Yes I am a poet. 
yes a poet ;
yes yes yes
a poet 
that writes.
Yes I am a poet.
Many poet writes in 
hindi gujarati
also in english 
But I write in 
C java 
also python.
Yes I am a poet. 
use of words 
in a beautiful manner 
also rhyming 
makes it a perfect poem
but when i writes it is 
known as
code code code.
Yes I am a poet.
poems give motivation 
also it makes day of people.
but there are many who don't
understand my poems.
though they don't understand 
it  is much useful for them 
in their daily life.
So I say and every coder says
Yes I am a poet.
Yes I am a poet. 
yes a poet ;
yes yes yes
a poet!
